## Intro to Python for Data Science

This workshop was given at the World Bank on Data Day 2019. It aims to:
 - Introduce the Jupyter Notebooks environment (via Google Colab)
 - Go through basics of Python coding
 - Walk through the data science pipeline (ingest, clean, analyze, visualize).
 
### Run notebooks on Colab:
 
The notebooks can be downloaded and run on your local machine using your Jupyter Notebooks installation (eg. Anaconda). But for the interactive session, we'll use Google Colab. Click below to launch in Colab:
